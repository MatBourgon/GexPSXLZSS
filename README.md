This program can decompress files stored in Gex 2: Enter the Gecko's BIGFILE.dat, either from pre-extracted files stored on disk, or while they are still stored in the BIGFILE.

When using the file decompression function, the compressed and uncompressed sizes will be automatically calculated.

When using the in-memory function, it is important to provide the exact size of the compressed block, as we cannot get the size in memory without re-processing the header, and the header is not guaranteed to always exist.
